//! The release gate: measures the engine's precision and recall against
//! `tests/corpus/expected.toml` rather than asserting either in prose. See
//! `tests/corpus/FORMAT.md` for the manifest contract this file implements.
//!
//! The corpus is scanned exactly once, as a whole, with `tests/corpus` as the
//! scan root. `Finding::location.file` is therefore already relative to
//! `tests/corpus`, which is exactly how `expected.toml` paths are written —
//! no rebasing is needed, and matching is a direct string comparison
//! (forward-slash-normalised, since the manifest is always written with `/`).
//!
//! The corpus content (`tests/corpus/vulnerable/**`, `tests/corpus/clean/**`)
//! is owned and written by a different task and may not exist yet, or may
//! exist only partially, in any given worktree. Rather than fail on that,
//! every `[[expect]]` entry whose file is not yet present on disk is treated
//! as "pending" and printed, not counted as a recall failure. Once the real

// Raised from 12 to 13 on 2026-09-22, admitting one deliberate new gap: a
// known_gap entry for vulnerable/real_misses/sql_from_tool_parameter.py,
// added alongside the new BAS-LLM10-008 rule (model output reaching SQL
// through a local variable, complementary to BAS-LLM10-003). BAS-LLM10-008
// asks the flow graph whether the value passed to .execute() traces back to
// a model call, and correctly stays silent when it instead traces back to a
// bare function parameter: a parameter resolves to Origin::Parameter, never
// Origin::Call{...}, and the flow graph has no concept that a parameter of
// an @tool-decorated function is agent-controlled. Catching that would need
// a new SourceKind plus a decorator-recognition pass -- separate, larger
// engine work, not attempted here.
//
// Lowered from 14 to 12 on 2026-08-28: the two eval_guarded_by_local_check.py
// entries moved out to `known_false_positive` (see MAX_KNOWN_FALSE_POSITIVES
// below). They were counted here since the "Admitted, +2" entry below, but
// they were never recall gaps -- BAS-LLM10-004 does not miss anything on
// that file, it over-reports on code that is provably safe. Counting a
// precision problem inside a recall-gap ceiling made `corpus_gate` print
// "promote to [[expect]]" for both every run, which would have asserted
// safe code is a defect had anyone followed the suggestion.
//
// 15 on 2026-08-28 morning, then two independent changes landed together:
// three gaps closed (-3) and two admitted (+2), giving 14.
//
// Closed, -3:
// Lowered from 15 to 12 on 2026-08-28: three JS/TS category gaps closed by
// adding the twins Python already had and JS/TS entirely lacked --
// BAS-LLM08-002 (secret in a prompt template), BAS-LLM06-002 (LLM call with
// no token ceiling), and BAS-ZT2-002 (wildcard tool grant). All three
// existing known_gap entries move to [[expect]] unchanged except line
// numbers where the shipped rule's actual match position differed from the
// pre-rule guess (BAS-LLM08-002 reports the `export const ... =` line, not
// the string's own line one below it). ZT2 in particular had defeated an
// earlier attempt: an ungated `$FN($$$PRE, "*")` is not a tool-grant
// pattern, it is "any call whose last argument is the string *", and
// matched CORS headers and route wildcards across the 65-repo measurement
// corpus. Gating FN on the same tool|agent substring the call's own name
// already carries (a structural fact about the function, not a guess about
// the value) closed the gap with zero of that noise.
//
// Admitted, +2 (later corrected -- see the 14-to-12 entry above):
// Raised from 15 to 17 on 2026-08-28, admitting what looked at the time like
// the one deliberate exception this constant's own doc comment allows: two
// known_gap entries were added for
// vulnerable/real_misses/eval_guarded_by_local_check.py, both false
// positives BAS-LLM10-004 cannot avoid without seeing a sibling statement
// (a prior assignment or guard clause) that this engine's `none:`/`inside:`
// have no way to reach -- see that file's docstring and bastyn.yml's comment
// on BAS-LLM10-004 for the full investigation. These run in the *opposite*
// direction from every other entry counted here: a precision gap (the rule
// over-triggers and cannot be told not to) rather than a recall gap (the
// rule misses a real defect). Recorded rather than papered over with an
// approximate `none:` pattern that would risk silently swallowing a real
// unvalidated eval() elsewhere. Filing them as `known_gap` was itself the
// mistake this comment thread describes admitting -- see the 14-to-12 entry
// above for where that got fixed.
// Lowered from 16 to 15 on 2026-08-28, on merging the routing fix with the
// dead-rule triage. Both branches independently promoted a gap on
// llm10_eval_on_model_reply.ts:40 and each expected its own rule to be the
// one that caught it. Only one rule survives: dropping the name gate made
// BAS-LLM10-005 fire, and it reaches .ts because JavaScript rules now compile
// against the TypeScript grammar. Its TypeScript twin was a byte-identical
// duplicate and is gone, so the expectation names BAS-LLM10-005.
// Lowered from 17 to 16 on 2026-08-28: vulnerable/zt4_no_delimiter.ts is now
// caught. Nothing about the rule changed. `language: javascript` rules were
// only ever compiled into the JavaScript bucket, so a `.ts` file was scanned
// by whichever rules happened to be declared `typescript` and silently skipped
// the rest. BAS-ZT4-003 had been correct the whole time and simply never ran
// on that file. Fixing the dispatch also made the two `language: typescript`
// rules redundant -- both were byte-identical copies of a JavaScript rule --
// so they were deleted, and the ZT1 credential expectation now names
// BAS-ZT1-003 rather than its removed duplicate.
//
// Lowered from 17 to 16 on 2026-08-28. Two gaps closed, one admitted:
//
//   - closed: `llm10_eval_on_model_reply.ts:40`. BAS-LLM10-008 dropped the
//     response/reply/... name gate on eval()'s argument. That gate was
//     measured, not guessed — across 65 real third-party repositories the
//     name-gated JS/TS eval rules never fired once, because real code names
//     the variable for what the value is (`expression`, `resolved`).
//   - closed: `llm03_excessive_agency.js:22`. BAS-LLM03-002 used to require
//     a `name:` property inside the SDK's tool({...}) call. That property
//     does not exist in the API it names; the tool's name is the binding.
//   - admitted: `llm03_excessive_agency.js:52`, the other binding shape (a
//     property key in a tools object), which ast-grep's JS `Pattern` cannot
//     express without matching approximately. See that entry for the
//     measurement.
//
// Raised from 7 to 17 on 2026-08-27, deliberately.
//
// TypeScript and JavaScript support landed, and with it a TS/JS corpus written
// against real LangChain.js, Vercel AI SDK and MCP SDK code. Of 11
// TS/JS instances, the new rules catch one. That is not a regression — none of
// it was detectable at all yesterday — but it is an honest admission that the
// engine now reads two more languages far better than the rules understand
// them.
//
// The cause is the same one the Python side already showed: metavariable
// keyword regexes do not survive real code. Real developers write
// `runbookText`, `suggestion` and `assistantNote`, not `llmResponse`.
// Raised from 5 to 7 on 2026-08-27, deliberately, with the reason recorded here
// because the constant exists to make exactly this visible:
//
// Scanning a real production application found two shapes the corpus did not
// cover — a system prompt override with three interpolations, and an
// uppercase-and-dashes admin token in a dict literal. Neither is a regression;
// both are blind spots that already existed and that the corpus was not yet
// honest enough to show. Adding them here is the corpus getting more truthful,
// not the scanner getting worse.
//
// The lesson worth keeping: a corpus written alongside the rules only tests
// what the rules already do. Both of these came from pointing the binary at
// code nobody wrote for it.

/// Known false positives today -- cases where a rule reports a finding that
/// is provably not a defect, and the exclusion cannot currently be expressed
/// precisely. This number must only ever go down, exactly like
/// `MAX_KNOWN_GAPS`, but it is tracked as its own ceiling rather than folded
/// into that one.
///
/// A recall gap and a precision gap are different debts, and conflating them
/// hides one inside the other's number: a reviewer asking "how many real
/// defects do we still miss" should not have that inflated by findings we
/// already know are spurious, and a reviewer asking "how noisy is this tool"
/// should not have that hidden inside the miss count. They also fail in
/// opposite directions, which is what actually forced the split -- treating
/// a known false positive as a `known_gap` makes `find_promotable` recommend
/// moving it to `[[expect]]` the moment the (already-present) finding is
/// observed, which for a false positive means asserting that safe code is a
/// defect.
///
/// Raising it means a rule started over-triggering on a new case that
/// cannot currently be excluded precisely -- that needs a human decision in
/// the PR description, not a silent bump, exactly like `MAX_KNOWN_GAPS`.

# Contributing to Bastyn

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is what you need to know before opening a pull request.

Participation is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Before you start

- **Bugs and small fixes.** Open a pull request directly. No issue needed.
- **New features, new commands, new rules.** Open an issue first so we can agree on the shape before you write code. This saves you building something we then ask you to restructure.
- **Security vulnerabilities in Bastyn itself.** Do not open a public issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Setup

You need Rust 1.88 or newer. [rustup](https://rustup.rs) will read `rust-toolchain.toml` and install the right toolchain and components automatically.

```console
git clone https://github.com/BASTYN-labs/bastyn-scan.git
cd bastyn-scan
cargo build
cargo test --workspace
```

## The checks CI runs

Run these locally before pushing; CI runs the same commands and will reject anything that fails them. The exact definitions are in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

```console
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
cargo build --release --locked
cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features --locked   # with RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"
cargo deny --all-features check                           # requires: cargo install cargo-deny
```

`--locked` makes CI fail rather than silently update `Cargo.lock`. Run it locally too; a lockfile change should be a deliberate commit. CI also sets `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`, so a warning you can ignore locally is a build failure there. Cargo passes `--cap-lints allow` to dependencies, so that only ever bites on our own code.

Two further checks run after `cargo build --release`:

```console
cargo test -p bastyn-core --test corpus_gate --locked -- --nocapture
```

The corpus gate measures precision and recall against `tests/corpus/`. `--nocapture` puts those numbers in the log of the run that changed them, so a regression is visible where it was caused rather than only as a red test.

The second is a self-scan that asserts the exit-code contract end to end. It runs the release binary, on that platform, against known-answer fixtures: `tests/fixtures/clean_agent` (expects `0`), `tests/fixtures/vulnerable_agent` (expects `1`), the same fixture with `--fail-on none` (expects `0`), and a path that does not exist (expects `2`). See "Stability contracts" below for what those codes mean, and `ci.yml` for the script.

CI additionally builds against the minimum supported Rust version declared in `Cargo.toml`. If your change needs a newer language feature, say so in the pull request. Raising the MSRV is a deliberate decision, not a side effect.

## Project layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/bastyn-core` | The engine: traversal, parsing, and analysis. No terminal I/O. |
| `crates/bastyn-cli` | The `bastyn` binary: argument parsing, rendering, exit codes. |

The rule that keeps this useful: **analysis logic goes in `bastyn-core`, never in the CLI.** If a change to `bastyn-cli` needs a unit test for its logic, that logic is probably in the wrong crate.

## Code standards

The workspace enforces these via `[workspace.lints]`; they are not style preferences you can argue past in review.

- `unsafe_code` is **forbidden**. There is no acceptable reason for a file scanner to need it.
- `unwrap`, `expect`, and `panic!` are warnings in library and binary code. A security scanner that panics on malformed input has failed at its job. Return an error and let the caller decide. They are permitted in tests, where a broken assumption should fail the test.
- Public items in `bastyn-core` need doc comments (`missing_docs` is a warning).
- Clippy runs with `pedantic` enabled.

## Tests

Every behavioural change needs a test. Concretely:

- **Engine changes.** Unit tests in `crates/bastyn-core`, using `tempfile` to build a real tree on disk. Test the behaviour, not the implementation.
- **CLI changes.** Integration tests in `crates/bastyn-cli/tests/`, driving the real binary with `assert_cmd`. This is what catches broken flags, wrong exit codes, and malformed output.
- **Output format changes.** Assert on the parsed JSON, not on a formatted string, so the test survives whitespace changes but catches contract breaks.

Determinism matters: traversal returns sorted paths so that two runs over an unchanged tree produce byte-identical output. Do not introduce ordering that depends on filesystem or thread scheduling.

## Commits and pull requests

- Write commit messages in the imperative mood: "add SARIF writer", not "added" or "adds".
- Keep unrelated changes in separate pull requests. A formatting sweep mixed into a bug fix makes the fix impossible to review.
- Describe what changed and why in the pull request body. If it changes user-visible behaviour, add an entry to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under `[Unreleased]`.
- Rebase rather than merge when updating a branch.

## Stability contracts

Two things in Bastyn are promises to users, not implementation details:

1. **The exit codes.** All three of them, listed below. People gate CI and pre-commit hooks on them.
2. **The `--format json` shape.** Fields may be added. Existing fields keep their names and meanings.

Changing either is a breaking change and needs a major version bump. Flag it explicitly in your pull request.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | The scan ran and reported nothing at or above the `--fail-on` threshold. `--fail-on none` always lands here, however much was found. |
| `1` | The scan ran and reported at least one finding at or above the threshold. |
| `2` | The scan could not run: an unreadable or missing path, an invalid argument, a malformed rule file. Nothing was analysed, so nothing was ruled out. |

The distinction that matters is `1` versus `2`. `1` is an answer: the tool worked and found something. `2` is the absence of one. A CI job that treats `2` as "findings" will report a broken scanner as a passing one, or vice versa. Keep them apart.

This contract is asserted by the self-scan step in `ci.yml`, mirrored in `action.yml`, and documented in the README. Do not repurpose a code without changing all of them together.

## Releasing

Only maintainers cut releases. Pushing a tag is the only thing that publishes anything: [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) triggers on tags matching `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*` and on nothing else, so merging to `main` never produces a release.

A repository ruleset named "release tags" enforces who may do that. Creating, updating or deleting any tag matching `v*.*.*` is restricted to repository admins and the release bot, so write access to the repository is not by itself enough to publish a release. The pattern deliberately stops short of the bare `vMAJOR` alias tag, because `major-alias` force-moves that one as `github-actions[bot]` and a rule covering it would block the workflow's own last step.

A release now updates four places, not just this repository: the GitHub Release itself, the `bastyn` and `bastyn-core` crates on crates.io, the `BASTYN-labs/homebrew-tap` formula, and (indirectly — no per-release action needed) the `install.sh` one-liner, which always resolves whatever the latest tag is. The crates.io and Homebrew updates only happen for a final `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag, same as the `major-alias` job — a release candidate updates GitHub Releases only.

Four version numbers have to agree before a tag will build. Three of them are checked, and a mismatch fails the release rather than publishing something inconsistent.

| Number | Where | What checks it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crate version | `version` under `[workspace.package]` in `Cargo.toml` | `verify` compares it to the tag |
| Lockfile | the `bastyn` and `bastyn-core` entries in `Cargo.lock` | every build runs `--locked` |
| Action default | `default:` on the `version` input in `action.yml` | `verify` compares it to the tag |
| Changelog heading | the version heading in `CHANGELOG.md` | nothing. Get it right by hand |

The `action.yml` default is the one people forget. It decides which binary a caller downloads when they do not name a version, so if it lags the tag, `uses: BASTYN-labs/bastyn-scan@v0.1.2` installs some other release's binary and pinning stops meaning anything. That happened once already; the check exists so it cannot happen twice.

### Cutting a release

1. Open a pull request against `main` that does the release bump and nothing else:
   - Set `version` in `Cargo.toml` to the new number.
   - Run `cargo build` and commit the updated `Cargo.lock`.
   - Set the `version` input's `default:` in `action.yml` to the tag, with the leading `v`.
   - In `CHANGELOG.md`, retitle `## [Unreleased]` as `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, put a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it, and update the link definitions at the bottom of the file.
2. Merge it. `main` requires a pull request and a passing `ci` run, so this is not a direct push.
3. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:

   ```console
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "bastyn v0.1.2"
   git push origin v0.1.2
   ```

Tag a commit that is already on `main`. A tag is not a promise that the code works, so `verify` runs the full test suite against the tagged commit before anything is published.

### What the tag triggers

| Job | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `verify` | `cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked`, then the two version checks above |
| `create-release` | Creates the GitHub release with generated notes, or reuses one that already exists |
| `upload-assets` | Builds `bastyn` for five targets, attaching each as an archive with a SHA-256 checksum |
| `major-alias` | Force-moves the `vMAJOR` tag onto the released commit |
| `release-gate` | Checks whether the tag is a final release (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, no suffix) — crates.io and the Homebrew tap are only updated for final releases |
| `publish-crates` | Publishes `bastyn-core` and `bastyn` to crates.io via Trusted Publishing (no long-lived token); final releases only |
| `render-and-verify-tap` | Renders the Homebrew formula, then verifies it with `brew audit`/`brew install`/`brew test` before anything is pushed; final releases only |
| `push-tap` | Pushes the verified formula to `BASTYN-labs/homebrew-tap`, using a GitHub App token scoped to that repo only; final releases only |

The five targets are `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. The Linux builds use musl so they are fully static: no host glibc version to match.

`major-alias` is what makes `uses: BASTYN-labs/bastyn-scan@v0` resolve to the newest 0.x release. It runs last and only after every target has uploaded, because a release missing the Windows archive is not one the alias should advertise. It also moves only for an exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` on a release that is neither a draft nor a prerelease, so tagging `v0.2.0-rc.1` leaves `v0` pointing where it was.

### One-time infrastructure setup

None of this is automated, and none of it repeats on later releases.

1. **crates.io Trusted Publishing.** Done: `bastyn-core` and `bastyn` are published (`0.1.4`), and `bastyn-scan`'s `publish-crates` job is registered as a Trusted Publisher for both (crates.io → each crate's settings → Trusted Publishing → GitHub Actions, repository `BASTYN-labs/bastyn-scan`, workflow file `release.yml`). Both crates also have "Require trusted publishing for all new versions" enabled, so a plain API token can no longer publish a new version even if one leaked.
2. **Homebrew tap repository.** Done: `BASTYN-labs/homebrew-tap` exists with an initial commit.
3. **GitHub App for the tap push.** Done: the `bastyn-tap-publisher` GitHub App is registered under `BASTYN-labs`, installed only on `BASTYN-labs/homebrew-tap` (Contents: Read and write, no other repository), and its App ID and private key are stored as the `bastyn-scan` repo secrets `HOMEBREW_TAP_APP_ID` and `HOMEBREW_TAP_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
4. **`bastyn-cli` tombstone crate.** Done: published once (`0.1.0`) to claim the old name before this rename could be squatted. Nothing to re-publish on later releases — crates.io versions are immutable.

### When a release fails

`verify` failing has published nothing. Delete the tag, fix the mismatch on `main`, and tag again:

```console
git push --delete origin v0.1.2
git tag --delete v0.1.2
```

If a single target fails after the release object exists, use "Re-run failed jobs" on that workflow run — this is always safe and is the preferred recovery. Re-running the *whole* workflow through `workflow_dispatch` with the same tag is only safe if `publish-crates` has not yet succeeded for that tag: crates.io rejects re-publishing an already-published version, so a full re-run after a successful `publish-crates` will fail on that job specifically, even though `create-release`/`upload-assets` remain safe to repeat (create-release reuses the existing release rather than replacing it).

Because `publish-crates`, `render-and-verify-tap`, and `push-tap` all run in parallel with `major-alias` rather than after it, a release can end up "partially complete" — a public GitHub Release and a moved `vMAJOR` alias, but crates.io or the Homebrew tap not yet updated because one of those jobs failed. This is an expected possible state given the pipeline's additive design, not necessarily a sign something is broken elsewhere; use "Re-run failed jobs" to finish the incomplete piece.

Do not delete or move a tag that has already published assets. People pin to it.
